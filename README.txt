Title:
Reactive astronaut

Desc:
A simple P5.js generator using particle effects to highlight its usage.

Questions:


1. Explain how your scene uses randomness: i.e. what is the pattern you observe in the inspiring image? What is the pattern you are using to place your shapes (it could be a simplification)?

My scene uses randomness in the creation of its particle effects when scrolling to the any point past the 2nd index (i.e. index > 2). I mainly chose this image because it is inspired me to listen to EMD music more as I 
found the image from doing audio reactivity programs. The pattern I observe is apparent in the rendering with the use of tilemaps, where I cut the image into smaller parts and box them accordingly.

2. Explain how your scene uses reactivity.  What is the input that it reacts to and what is the logic and reasoning for the reaction? 

My scene uses reactivity through user input by allowing them to slide the scroller to see different effects and reactivity. The logic is based on user input and to see the random effects that appear, albeit there are only
certain select effects the way that they are generated is through a particle effects generator.

3. What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect? If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing? 

The effect I am trying to achieve is the use of p5.js to manipulate an image in different ways in order to observe how the an image can be rendered with different effects. As seen by the last index of the scroller, I was able to 
fully render the pixels into a full particle effect and completely remove its color and attributes . I don't think there was much limitation artistically when it comes to the usage of p5.js as the library is incredibly modular
and allows you to modify an image on a similar level to that of any video/image editor.
